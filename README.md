# Maps-Backend

## Description
This module manages communication between the Google API and the app. Location data is loaded from the user, extrapolated with the Google API and pushed to a database on AWS

### Current status
- test file that takes a geostring from the console and outputs the address of the top hit from Google maps 
  - this file should eventually push to AWS S3 using a protocol similar to its Google API request
